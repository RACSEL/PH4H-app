## Setup your environment

Before you start running the project you will need to setup your configurations. We have the basic setup inside the `.env.sample` file. Please copy it into your custom `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

The `.env` will contain these values:

```shell
# Backend API
API_ENDPOINT=''

# Keycloak
KEYCLOAK_ENDPOINT=''
# Name of the realm created on keycloak
KEYCLOAK_REALM=''
# Client id you can get from inside keycloak admin-cli client credentials settings
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=''
# Refresh token key, on keycloak is refresh_token
KEYCLOAK_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY=''

# IPS
# The number of days the user's IPS bundle will be stored in the device storage after fetching it from 
# the FHIR server
IPS_EXP_DAYS=6

# VHL
# The number of days the generated QR code will expire
VHL_EXPIRATION_DAYS=14
# In case you want to add a passcode to the generated QR code
VHL_PASS_CODE='0000'
```

All other settings are optional. If you want to customize color, icons, locales, etc, please check the details on this [guide](./docs/customize-your-app.md).
